# Root Cause Analysis & Recommendations

## Key Issues Identified
| Root Cause | Evidence from Dashboard | Business Impact |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| No Eligibility Verification | High Eligibility Denials | Preventable revenue loss before submission |
| Coding Errors | High Coding Denials from certain departments | Rework cost and claim delays |
| Lack of Feedback Loop | Same denial codes repeatedly occurring | Operational inefficiency and repeated waste |

---

## Data-Driven Recommendations

### Implement Eligibility Pre-Checks
- Validate insurance coverage at the front desk
- Use automated eligibility APIs where possible  
**Expected Benefit:** Reduce eligibility-related denials by 30–40%

---

### Coding Validation Before Submission
- Introduce rules-based validation during coding entry
- Conduct periodic coding refresh training  
**Expected Benefit:** Material reduction in coding denials (20–25%)

---

### Weekly Denial Review & Feedback Loop
- Denial team sends recurring trends to coding and front office
- Cross-department action plan for top 5 denial drivers  
**Expected Benefit:** Sustained improvement and fewer repeated denials

---

## Monitoring KPIs
- Denial Rate %
- Preventable Denied %
- Affected Department Trends
- Payer Contribution to Denials

Success is measured through **continuous decline in preventable denials**.
